# Week 1 Standup

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - This week, I researched and learned about project management, command-line/terminal commands, setting up Git, and connecting it to my GitHub account. I also learned how to use GitHub to create and clone a repository, create and manage issues and commit work. To pull it all together, I built the homepage of the ReadySetTravel website at the end of the week using HTML and CSS. Overall, it was a great experience, and I look forward to the work ahead required to reach Milestone 2!

üåµ Challenges - This week, I had a weird issue with the HTML validation portion of this assignment, where I was seeing about 23 warning messages for the index.html page of this project. The warnings said that it was unnecessary to include a trailing `/` at the end of HTML tags that don't have a closing tag which I found out are known as void tags. I researched void tags and learned that the warnings were caused by the VS Code Extension, Prettier, and how it formats HTML code. After removing the extension and removing the trailing slashes on existing void tags in the index.html file, I was able to fix the warnings. Now, my page is 100% valid according to the W3C Validator.

üèÜ Accomplishments - This week I challenged myself to build the homepage of the ReadySetTravel website without using a CSS Framework. I thought that using vanilla CSS would be beneficial to me so I can learn and better familiarize myself with all the rules and selectors that CSS has to offer. I'm happy to say I think my initial build of the site came out good and I hope that the CSS stylesheets I wrote will continue to be flexible with any future changes required to reach future milestones.

üîÆ Next Steps - I plan to further refine the initial build of the ReadySetTravel website as new features are introduced, and the project evolves over the coming weeks. I can't wait to see what we'll do as we progress toward Milestone 2!
