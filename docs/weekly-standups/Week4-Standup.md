# Week 4 Standup

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - As the project comes to a close in this final week, I spent most of my time putting the finishing touches on the Ready Set Travel website. I spent some time modifying the site's responsive design by changing how some elements flow across some of my grid layouts on mid-sized screens. I re-scanned the site using all the recommended accessibility tools, including Chrome Dev tools, Firefox Accessibility tools, and the Wave browser extension. I made some incremental improvements to the accessibility of the site based on the results of the scans, including improvements to color scheme contrast and HTML semantics. I also added some metadata to the pages to improve the user experience for screen reader users. Finally, as a final challenge for myself, I added some additional JavaScript-powered functionality to the site. With this project's final commit, the site dynamically loads the blog article content using JavaScript custom objects. It also indicates to the user the current page they are on by highlighting specific links in the header and footer navigation menus. And lastly, I added a copyright statement to the footer that dynamically updates to show the current year. Overall, I had a great time building this project, and I'm really proud of what I've built this month.

üåµ Challenges - In this final week, I had some trouble figuring out if there was anything that I could do better. I believe my existing self-taught knowledge combined with the new material enabled me to build a really solid final product. While it took me some time to figure out what JavaScript code I needed to write to add the additional features to the Ready Set Travel site, I still figured things out and got things up and running. While writing the JavaScript code, I realized that I am still relatively new to JavaScript as a programming language. So, to address my lack of experience, I plan to practice my JavaScript skills for the next six weeks as I move on to English Composition and the holiday break.

üèÜ Accomplishments - This week, I leveled up my JavaScript skills by adding a few dynamic things to the website that weren't required. I enjoyed creating my own JavaScript challenges and figuring things out independently. These three challenges, the dynamic copyright statement, the dynamic blog content from JavaScript Objects, and the current page highlights, were challenging enough yet simple. I chose these challenges because I think they are standard features included in most websites today. While the blog content would normally load from an external API, it was nice to get my feet wet with the concept of local JavaScript objects. Based on how I completed all three challenges, I would say I leveled up my JavaScript skills this week.

üîÆ Next Steps - In terms of my future plans, I plan to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills over the next six weeks. Since we won't be coding or doing anything web-related for the next class and the holiday break, I must practice to keep my skills sharp. That way, after the break, I will be in an excellent position to further my JavaScript skills and begin learning about JavaScript frameworks such as React.
