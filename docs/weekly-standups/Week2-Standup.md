# Week 2 Standup

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - This past week I worked on improving my initial HTML and CSS code by implementing my current understanding of the BEM CSS class naming methodology. I also learned about prototyping and was introduced to a popular UI/UX design tool, Figma. Using Figma, I created mockups for four additional pages that I will build later and add to this project in the coming weeks. While using Figma, I discovered an icon library called Iconify that can be added to this project by inserting some JavaScript. Therefore, I replaced the original icon images in the project with Iconify Icons that closely match the icons in the original design assets. Toward the end of the week, with my prototype finished, I created an HTML snippets template file containing a few repeatable elements and sections that I will use to build the four remaining pages next week. Overall, it was a positive learning experience, and I think I‚Äôm in a good place to continue developing this project in the coming weeks.

üåµ Challenges - This week I had a few problems related to semantics in HTML and implementing the BEM CSS class naming methodology. In terms of HTML, I‚Äôm not sure if I fully understand the usage of the `<article>` tag yet. However, I learned that my page should contain a `<main>` tag. In terms of the BEM CSS class naming methodology, I believe I mostly implemented it correctly, but I am not sure about a few of the names I decided to use for some elements. Therefore, I plan to research the `<article>` tag and BEM CSS class naming methodology further. When I gain further clarity on both subjects, I will make changes to the project accordingly. I also plan to ask questions about these topics during the coming days and weeks.

üèÜ Accomplishments - This week I challenged myself to refactor the code I initially wrote for the homepage of the ReadySetTravel website. I not only successfully refactored my code with only a few minor issues, but I was also able to successfully implement the BEM CSS class naming methodology based on my current understanding. It is my understanding that the current state of my CSS class names is in line with the BEM methodology, but there may be some additional room for improvement, and I plan to make those improvements in the coming weeks. Overall, by using the BEM methodology, I have put myself in a great place to build the remaining pages of the ReadySetTravel website quickly and easily using a modular structure based on design components.

üîÆ Next Steps - I plan to develop the ReadySetTravel website further as new features are introduced, and the project evolves over the next two weeks. Next week, I look forward to building the additional four pages of the website and will do my best to match the look and feel of the prototype I created for each page. I also look forward to finding the answers to my questions from week two related to HTML semantics and the BEM CSS class naming methodology.
